## Setup:
- Download and install Fly-by-Wire on a compatible iPhone
- Download and install Infinite Flight on a separate device
- Make sure both devices are connected to the same Wi-Fi network
- Run Infinite Flight. Make sure Settings -> General -> "Enable Infinite Flight Connect" is checked.
- Open Fly-by-Wire. Within 10 seconds, a message telling you that you are connected to Infinite Flight should appear.

### Yoke:
- Hold the device horizontally in both hands, in a traditional yoke-like fashion.
- Move the device to get a feel for the accelerometer pitch and roll.
- Buttons can only be pressed when they are allowed. If you're on the ground, or in a plane with no spoilers, these buttons won't work.
- Reverse thrust only toggles when you are on the ground with the throttle at 0. Advance the throttle with reverse enabled to reverse.
- Touch and drag on the camera to move the view. Tap once to cycle views, tap and hold to toggle the HUD.
- Have fun!
