		<h2>Setup:</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Download and install Fly-by-Wire on a compatible iPhone</li>
				<li>Download and install Infinite Flight on a separate device</li>
				<li>Make sure both devices are connected to the same Wi-Fi network</li>
				<li>Run Infinite Flight. Make sure Settings -> General -> "Enable Infinite Flight Connect" is checked.</li>
				<li>Open Fly-by-Wire. Within 10 seconds, a message telling you that you are connected to Infinite Flight should appear.</li>
			</ul>

		<h3>Yoke:</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Hold the device horizontally in both hands, in a traditional yoke-like fashion.</li>
				<li>Move the device to get a feel for the accelerometer pitch and roll.</li>
				<li>Buttons can only be pressed when they are allowed. If you're on the ground, or in a plane with no spoilers, these buttons won't work.</li>
				<li>Reverse thrust only toggles when you are on the ground with the throttle at 0. Advance the throttle with reverse enabled to reverse.</li>
				<li>Touch and drag on the camera to move the view. Tap once to cycle views, tap and hold to toggle the HUD.</li>
				<li>Have fun!</li>
			</ul>
