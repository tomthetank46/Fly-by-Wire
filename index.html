    <h2>Mobile Yoke and Joystick for iPhone</h2>

    <p>Mobile flight simulation is a revolution - the world in the palm of your hand. Fly-by-Wire is a mobile yoke and joystick to add that extra bit of realism and help you grease that next landing.</p>

    <p>Fly-by-Wire is a third-party add-on for the popular mobile flight simulator Infinite Flight. Fly-by-Wire allows your phone to function as a yoke or joystick, along with a full set of flight controls. Simply turn it on, connect it, and off you go.</p>

    <h3> The Yoke</h3>

    <p>The Yoke setting features all the commands you could need to safely fly your plane from a separate device. These include:<p>

    <ul>
      <li>Accelerometer-based pitch and roll</li>
      <li>Throttle control (with reverse thrust)</li>
      <li>Flaps</li>
      <li>Spoilers</li>
      <li>Lights</li>
      <li>Short-press to cycle camera and long-press to cycle the HUD</li>
      <li>Cockpit camera movement</li>
      <li>On-screen rudder</li>
      <li>Gear</li>
      <li>Brakes</li>
      <li>Stick-shaker stall-warning</li>
      <li>Automatic autopilot activation in case of a disconnect</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>The Joystick</h3>

    <p>The Joystick setting is more simplistic, but it allows for an unprecedented variety of flight; devoting one hand to the flight controls and leaving the other free to tend to on-screen actions.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Accelerometer-based pitch, roll, and yaw</li>
      <li>Brakes</li>
      <li>Short-press to cycle camera and long-press to cycle the HUD</li>
      <li>Cockpit camera movement</li>
      <li>Stick-shaker stall-warning</li>
      <li>Automatic autopilot activation in case of a disconnect</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Compatibility</h2>
    <p>Fly-by-Wire is currently only compatible with iPhone.</p>
