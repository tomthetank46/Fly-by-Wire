      <h2>Mobile Yoke and Joystick for iPhone</h2>

      <p>If you’ve ever wished you could fly the infinite skies while controlling your plane from an affordable and simple, realistic-feeling yoke or joystick all while keeping the mobile experience, then look no further!</p>

      <p>We’ve developed and tested this app with the help of real-world pilots, and now it’s your turn to take it for a spin.</p>

      <p>Fly-by-Wire uses Infinite Flight’s Connect API to send and receive commands from the simulator. Fly-by-Wire allows your phone to function as a yoke or joystick, along with a full set of flight controls. Simply turn it on, connect it, and off you go.</p>


      <h3> The Yoke</h3>

      <p>The Yoke setting features all the commands you could need to safely fly your plane from a separate device. These include:<p>

      <ul>
        <li>Accelerometer-based pitch and roll</li>
        <li>Throttle control (with reverse thrust)</li>
        <li>Flaps</li>
        <li>Spoilers</li>
        <li>Lights</li>
        <li>Short-press to cycle camera and long-press to cycle the HUD</li>
        <li>Camera movement</li>
        <li>On-screen rudder (with drag-to-brake)</li>
        <li>Gear</li>
        <li>Brakes</li>
        <li>Automatic autopilot activation in case of a disconnect</li>
        <li>Autopilot panel</li>
        <li>ATC panel</li>
        <li>Trim</li>
        <li>Individual engine start/stop</li>
        <li>Pushback toggle</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>The Joystick</h3>

      <p>The Joystick setting is more simplistic, but it allows for an unprecedented variety of flight; devoting one hand to the flight controls and leaving the other free to tend to on-screen actions.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Accelerometer-based pitch, roll, and yaw</li>
        <li>Brakes</li>
        <li>Short-press to cycle camera and long-press to cycle the HUD</li>
        <li>Cockpit camera movement</li>
        <li>Automatic autopilot activation in case of a disconnect</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Compatibility</h2>
      <p>Fly-by-Wire is currently only compatible with iPhone.</p>

      <h2>Pricing</h2>
      <p>Fly-by-Wire is priced at $4.99 and will be available on the App Store. This price is subject to change and may be changed at any time.</p>
