## Mobile Yoke and Joystick for iPhone

Mobile flight simulation is a revolution - the world in the palm of your hand. Fly-by-Wire is a mobile yoke and joystick to add that extra bit of realism and help you grease that next landing.

Fly-by-Wire is a third-party add-on for the popular mobile flight simulator Infinite Flight. Fly-by-Wire allows your phone to function as a yoke or joystick, along with a full set of flight controls. Simply turn it on, connect it, and off you go.

### The Yoke

The Yoke setting features all the commands you could need to safely fly your plane from a separate device. These include:

* Accelerometer-based pitch and roll
* Throttle control (with reverse thrust)
* Flaps
* Spoilers
* Lights
* Camera Control
* On-screen rudder
* Gear
* Brakes
* Stick-shaker stall-warning
* Automatic autopilot activation in case of a disconnect

### The Joystick

The Joystick setting is more simplistic, but it allows for an unprecedented variety of flight; devoting one hand to the flight controls and leaving the other free to tend to on-screen actions.

* Accelerometer-based pitch, roll, and yaw
* Brakes
* Camera control
* Stick-shaker stall-warning
* Automatic autopilot activation in case of a disconnect

## Compatibility
Fly-by-Wire is currently only compatible with iPhone.

## Pricing
