# Welcome to Fly-by-Wire

## What is it?

Mobile flight simulation is a revolution - the world in the palm of your hand. We've created a mobile yoke and joystick to add that extra bit of realism and grease that next landing.

Fly-by-Wire is a third-party add-on that allows your phone to function as a yoke or joystick. Simply turn it on, connect it, and off you go.

### The Yoke
The Yoke setting features all the commands you could need to safely fly your plane. These include:
- Accelerometer-based pitch and roll
- Throttle control (with reverse thrust)
- Flaps
- Spoilers
- Lights
- Camera Control
- On-screen rudder
- Gear
- Brakes
- Stick-shaker stall-warning

### The Joystick
The Joystick setting is more simplistic, but it allows for an unprecedented variety of flight while leaving a hand free to tend to on-screen actions.
- Accelerometer-based pitch, roll, and yaw
- Brakes
- Camera control
- Stick-shaker stall-warning

## Where did this come from?
Our leading developer is a glider pilot, through-and-through. Tilting a device is fun, but what if there was a way to control the sim using a phone like a joystick? An idea was born. This grew to encompass a yoke setting, many more commands, and a lot of learning, eventually becoming Fly-by-Wire.

## How do I use it?
Download and install the app. Connect to the same WiFi network as your sim. Once Fly-by-Wire displays as connected, move your device and press the buttons to get familiar. If you're using the yoke, hold the device in front of you in the traditional way. If you're using the joystick, hold the device in your right hand, vertically, with the screen facing left and the volume buttons pointed forward. Tilt around to get a feel for it!
