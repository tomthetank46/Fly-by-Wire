## Mobile Flight Controls

Mobile flight simulation is a revolution - the world in the palm of your hand. Fly-by-Wire is a mobile yoke and joystick to add that extra bit of realism and grease that next landing.

Fly-by-Wire is a third-party add-on for the popular mobile flight simulator Infinite Flight. Fly-by-Wire allows your phone to function as a yoke or joystick. Simply turn it on, connect it, and off you go.

### The Yoke
The Yoke setting features all the commands you could need to safely fly your plane. These include:
- Accelerometer-based pitch and roll
- Throttle control (with reverse thrust)
- Flaps
- Spoilers
- Lights
- Camera Control
- On-screen rudder
- Gear
- Brakes
- Stick-shaker stall-warning

### The Joystick
The Joystick setting is more simplistic, but it allows for an unprecedented variety of flight while leaving a hand free to tend to on-screen actions.
- Accelerometer-based pitch, roll, and yaw
- Brakes
- Camera control
- Stick-shaker stall-warning

## How do I use it?
Download and install the app. Connect the device running Fly-by-Wire to the same WiFi network as the device running Infinite Flight. Once Fly-by-Wire displays as connected, move your device and press the buttons to get familiar. If you're using the yoke, hold the device in front of you in the traditional way. If you're using the joystick, hold the device in your right hand, vertically, with the screen facing left and the volume buttons pointed forward. Tilt around to get a feel for it!
